# Object Detection with YOLO11

## Project Overview
This project is an advanced object detection model built using YOLO11, a deep learning-based algorithm known for real-time object detection capabilities. The model is designed to detect multiple objects within an image or video stream, demonstrating my expertise in computer vision and model optimization for high-performance applications.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Capable of detecting objects in real-time with high accuracy and speed.
- **Custom Training and Fine-Tuning**: The model has been fine-tuned on [your custom dataset or mention any specific dataset used].
- **Scalable and Modular Design**: Easily adaptable for different object classes or domains by retraining with new data.
- **Application-Ready**: Suitable for use cases such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and retail analytics.

## Demo
Check out some sample detections in the [Demo Section](#demo-section), or run the model locally to see it in action.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-yolo11.git
   cd object-detection-yolo11
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download YOLO11 pre-trained weights [link if applicable] and place them in the `models/` directory.

## Usage
After installation, you can test the object detection model on an image, video, or live webcam feed:

```bash
python detect.py --source path/to/image_or_video --weights path/to/yolo11_weights
```

### Example
```python
from yolo_detector import YOLODetector
detector = YOLODetector(weights='models/yolo11_weights.pth')
detector.detect(image='sample.jpg')
```

## Model Details
- **Architecture**: YOLO11 offers an improvement over previous YOLO versions, utilizing [describe architecture improvements if any].
- **Training Dataset**: The model was trained on [mention dataset name or describe your custom dataset if applicable].
- **Augmentation Techniques**: Data augmentation techniques like [list techniques used] were applied to improve robustness and accuracy.

## Project Structure
- `detect.py` - Main script for running detections.
- `yolo_detector.py` - Contains the YOLO detector class.
- `data/` - Sample images and videos for testing.
- `models/` - Directory to store YOLO11 weights.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies.

## Performance Metrics
The model has been evaluated on [mention dataset] and achieves:
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: [mAP score]
