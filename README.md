# Object Detection with YOLO11

## Project Overview
This project implements a state-of-the-art object detection model using the YOLO11 (You Only Look Once) algorithm, a deep learning-based algorithm known for real-time object detection capabilities. The model is designed to detect multiple objects within an image or video stream

## Key Features
  * Supports detection of a wide variety of common objects (e.g., vehicles, people, animals, etc.)
  * Leverages the powerful YOLO11 algorithm for fast and accurate object detection
  * Includes pre-trained weights for improved out-of-the-box performance
  * Supports both CPU and GPU acceleration for optimal inference speed
  * Includes comprehensive documentation and examples for getting started

## Technologies Used
 -  Python
 -  PyTorch
 -  OpenCV
 -  YOLO11 (Ultralytics)
